- 🔭 **I’m currently working on:**  
  

- **🕸️ Agentic AI & LLM Workflows**  
  Actively building with **LangChain**, **LangGraph**, and **CrewAI** to develop autonomous AI agents that reason, retain memory, and use tools effectively. I'm exploring prompt engineering, multi-agent coordination, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), and real-time decision-making using **OpenAI**, **Gemini**, and **Retell AI**.

- **📊 Real-World Analytics**  
  Created Power BI dashboards and automated ETL pipelines during internships and freelance projects. Experience includes financial reporting, utilization metrics, Power Automate workflows, and data-driven insights for decision-making.

- **⚙️ Transitioning into MLOps**  
  Currently exploring **MLOps** to streamline the deployment, monitoring, and scaling of ML models in production. Learning to use tools like **Docker**, **Azure Machine Learning**, **CI/CD**, and model versioning systems to build robust AI workflows.
